                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <p>    The first level of education is for two years of study and includes 80 CP. This level is designed for training in a wide range of specialties. Upon completion the student will receive a diploma of the first level of higher education.</p>
                  <p>    The second level of education is for four years, and contains 160 CP. Upon completion the student will receive a diploma of the second level of higher education ( Bachelor ).</p>
                  <p>    In order to obtain a Bachelor's degree is necessary to study 3 ­ 4 years (180­240 ECTS). After graduating from bachelor degree, graduates can get a job in their profession and take aposition, requiring a university degree, or continue their studies in the master's program. Education at undergraduate level is possible on full­time, part­time and as distance learning.</p>
                  <p>    Learning Masters lasts 1 ­ 2.5 years. Master's degree allows you to qualify for higher positions and salary levels, as well as allows you to continue training in doctoral studies. Education is possible in full­time and distance form.</p>
                  <p>    At the end of Master's styudy the graduates will acquire a number of advantages :</p>
                  <p>    ­ Getting deeper knowledge in the scientific field of interest ­ The ability to engage in research activities</p>



            <h2>        The ability to engage in research activities</h2>
                <p>    Preparation of teaching experience</p>
                  <p>  Education in doctoral program lasts 3 years. Upon completion, graduates receive a PhD in a particular area. Doctoral degree prepares students for the degree of Doctor of Science. Education is possible only personally.</p>
                <h2>    Forms of education</h2>
                  <p>  Full­time form of training ­ training is conducted with the separation from work, as opposed to remote and correspondence. training structure is built on personal contact with the student's teacher, which helps the absorption of high­quality material and obtaining more knowledge. Full­time students are required to attend lectures, seminars and practical training.</p>
                  <p>  Part­time ­ combines self­study and classroom training. Most of the subjects the students learn independently. The main difference between the distform of distance learing is its duration and the possibility of continuing working activity. Students of distance learning study in two periods. The first period ­ this introductory lecture, in which teachers give references, abstracts, threads, control tasks, etc. Second period is the exam session.</p>


                  <p>  Distance learning ­ learning takes place at a distance, by means of the Internet ­ technologies and other means of interactive communication. The main difference between distance learning is drawing up an individual training plan, agreed upon by the student and a teacher. A student can get advice from your teacher on their questions via the Internet, telephone, etc. Diploma of distance learning is no different from the usual.</p>
